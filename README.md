Title: Are You Worthy of Thors Hammer?
Secondary: Games to prove your skills to the Gods. 
Logo: C:\Users\user\CS3__2ndQuarter_Potassium_CN13_C23\Projects\Images\pixil-frame-0.png

Description: Our website is based on Thor, both his Marvel and Norse mythology iterations. Each webpage will be a different game with score goals in order to be deemed "worthy" of using Mjolnir, Thor's hammer. Our games will test the user's "worthiness" through reaction time, trivia, memorization, hand eye coordination, and maybe more. So test out your skills and see if you have what it truly takes to handle the power of a god!

How JS will be implemented: JavaScript will be used to create the interactive games on each webpage. For example, in the trivia game, JavaScript will handle user input, check answers, and calculate scores. In the memorization game, JavaScript will manage the flipping of cards and track matched pairs. Additionally, JavaScript will be used for dynamic content updates, such as displaying score results and providing feedback to users based on their performance in each game.
